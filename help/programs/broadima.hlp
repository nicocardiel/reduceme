#KEY: explanation
Broaden selected spectra of an image by introducing an
additional velocity dispersion.
#KEY: error types
Two different kinds of error spectra can be computed:
1 - initial error spectra can be transformed like a normal
spectra, i.e., the program broadens the original error
spectra.
2 - the program can compute the propagation of errors when
broadening the data spectra, by using the error spectra
and following the law of combination of errors.
