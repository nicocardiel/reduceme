#KEY: explanation
Generates a flux calibration spectrum, fitting by splines
the ratio between the tabulated and observed spectrum of a
spectrophotometric standard star.
#KEY: image instead of spectrum
If the input file corresponds to an image, the program
allows to extract a single spectrum by adding the desired
scan region.
