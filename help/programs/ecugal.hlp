#KEY: explanation
Transforms r.a. and dec. to galactic coordinates.
#KEY: HH.MMSS
R.A. is entered in the form HH.MMSS, where HH, MM and SS
are hours, minutes and seconds, respectively. Fractions of
secons are not allowed.
#KEY: DD.MMSS
Dec. is entered in the form +/-DD.MMSS, where +/-, DD, MM
and SS are declination sign, degrees, arc-minutes and
arc-seconds, respectively.  Fractions of secons are not
allowed.
#KEY: output
Galactic coordinates are given in degrees and fraction of
degree.
