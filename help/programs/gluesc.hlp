#KEY: explanation
Takes different spectra and creates a new frame (in which
each individual spectrum corresponds to the former
spectra).
#KEY: header file
The header file contains information from the header of all
the initial files employed by gluesc. This file can be read
from the program index, allowing to obtain a list of
measured indices in a frame containing spectra from
different images.
