#KEY: explanation
Add channels of an image, generating a new image with the 
same NSCAN (pixels in the spatial direction) and variable
NCHAN (pixels in the wavelength direction).
#KEY: selection
Each new channel in the final image is computed by adding
the channels of the original frame comprised between the
(1st channel) and (1st channel)+(No. of Channels-1). The
added new channel is finally multiplied by the real number
Factor.
