#KEY: explanation
Cross-correlates spectra using FFT.
#KEY: number of reference spectra
Although the cross-correlation is performed by comparing
two single spectra, the program allows to compare the same
PROBLEM spectrum versus different REFERENCE spectra.
#KEY: image instead of spectrum
If the entered file name corresponds to an image (instead
of a single spectrum), the program asks for the scan number
of this image to be employed.
