#KEY: explanation
Measures indices in a fully calibrated image (exception
made for the flux calibration). The program requires an
external file containing the index definitions.  For this
purpose, the program looks first for a file called
'myindex.dat' in the current directory. If this file does
not exist, the program then looks for a file called
'index.dat' (located in the subdirectory 'files' of the
distribution package). If this last file is also missing,
the program stops.
